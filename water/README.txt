# AI-Powered Smart Water Management System for Sustainable Water Resources

## Project Overview

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to address critical water management challenges, focusing on enhancing water security and optimizing resource utilization. It introduces a dual-model approach designed to provide both strategic foresight for long-term planning and real-time operational efficiency in combating water waste.

## Problem Statement

[**Describe the specific water challenge you are addressing, e.g., in Jordan.** You can use points from your presentation's Slide 2 here.]
- [Example: Jordan faces extreme water scarcity, significantly below the international water poverty line.]
- [Example: High rates of non-revenue water (NRW) due to leaks and inefficient infrastructure.]
- [Example: Increasing demand driven by population growth and regional challenges.]

## Solution Overview

Our system provides a comprehensive AI-driven solution by integrating two core machine learning models:

1.  **Annual Water Deficit Prediction Model:** Provides strategic foresight for proactive national planning and resource allocation.
2.  **Smart Water Meter Leak Detection Model:** Offers real-time operational insights to identify and minimize water losses from the distribution network.

This integrated approach aims to support data-driven decision-making, enhance environmental sustainability, improve social well-being through water security, and strengthen governance frameworks (ESG).

## Features

* **Annual Water Deficit Forecasting:** Predicts future water deficits based on various hydrological, economic, and demographic indicators.
* **Real-time Leak Detection:** Identifies anomalous water consumption patterns from smart meters to pinpoint potential leaks.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Transforms complex water data into actionable intelligence for stakeholders.
* **Contribution to ESG Goals:** Directly supports Environmental (E), Social (S), and Governance (G) objectives in water management.

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Core Libraries:**
    * `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
    * `numpy` for numerical operations
    * `scikit-learn` for machine learning models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression)
    * `matplotlib` for data visualization
    * `seaborn` for enhanced data visualization
* [Add any other specific tools or libraries you used, e.g., if you used specific environments like Anaconda, mention it.]

## Dataset

This project utilizes two primary datasets:

1.  **`water_data.csv`:** Contains historical data related to water indicators (e.g., Water Productivity, Water Stress, Annual Rainfall, etc.) used for the Annual Water Deficit Prediction Model.
2.  **`smart.txt`:** Contains simulated or real smart meter consumption data, including timestamps and consumption volumes, used for the Leak Detection Model.

[You can add a brief description of where the data came from if it's publicly available, or acknowledge it's simulated/sample data.]

## Setup and Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/[YourRepositoryName].git
    cd [YourRepositoryName]
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```
    

## Usage

After setting up the environment and installing dependencies:

1.  **For Annual Water Deficit Prediction:**
    * Ensure `water_data.csv` is in the project directory.
    * Run the script:
        ```bash
        python water_deficit_prediction.py
        ```
    * This script will train the model, evaluate its performance, and generate `actual_vs_predicted_water_deficit.png`.

2.  **For Smart Water Meter Leak Detection:**
    * Ensure `smart.txt` is in the project directory.
    * Run the script:
        ```bash
        python smartLeak.py
        ```
    * This script will train a classification model, evaluate its performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix), and generate `leak_detection_predictions.png`.

## Results (Summary)

### Model 1: Annual Water Deficit Prediction
* **Model Type:** Linear Regression
* **Key Performance Metric:** R-squared ($R^2$) Score: [Your R2 Score, e.g., 1.0000]
* **Summary:** The model demonstrates [describe the performance, e.g., "exceptionally high accuracy in predicting annual water deficits, providing a reliable tool for strategic planning."].

### Model 2: Smart Water Meter Leak Detection
* **Model Type:** Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
* **Key Performance Metrics:**
    * Accuracy: [Your Accuracy, e.g., 0.8276]
    * Precision: [Your Precision, e.g., 0.0000]
    * Recall: [Your Recall, e.g., 0.0000]
    * F1-Score: [Your F1-Score, e.g., 0.0000]
* **Summary:** [Describe the performance honestly but constructively, e.g., "While the model accurately identifies non-leak scenarios, current results indicate a need for further refinement, particularly in identifying actual leak instances. This may involve further feature engineering, dataset balancing, or exploring alternative algorithms to enhance its precision and recall for leak detection."].

## Future Enhancements

* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Incorporate more sophisticated features derived from existing data (e.g., time-series analysis for consumption patterns).
* **Integration of External Data:** Include weather forecasts, demographic shifts, and economic indicators for more robust predictions.
* **Real-time Dashboard Development:** Create an interactive dashboard for live monitoring and visualization of water deficit forecasts and leak alerts.
* **Predictive Maintenance:** Extend the leak detection model to predict potential infrastructure failures proactively.
* **Algorithm Optimization:** Explore other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) and hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.
